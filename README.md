- 👋 Hi, I’m @sraber
- 👀 Generally speaking, I’m interested in numerical methods.  I have a master’s degree in mechanical engineering and focused on numerical solutions to partial differential equations.  Professionally I made my living as a programmer working on Engineering software and spent a lot of time “in” the spectral domain.  
- 🌱 Currently my focus is on neural networks and AI.  I have the time, it’s sexy, and it is something one can study and contribute to without the support of an organization.  
- 💞️ I have some ideas I want to pursue such as object recognition in the log-polar domain, and I can’t stop thinking about how there must be a better way to train networks than gradient descent.  I am open to collaborating on something.
